# Objective:
- Build a Memory Game using React, focusing on the practical application of Hooks (such as useState and useEffect) to manage state and handle side effects when fetching data from an external API [(Dragon Ball Api)](https://web.dragonball-api.com/).

# Key Requirements: 
- Dynamic Data: Fetch images and information (like names or descriptions) from an external API.
- Players click on cards to earn points.
- The game board must shuffle and display the cards in a random order after every click.
- The game tracks if a card has been clicked before; the goal is to click each card only once.
- Scorekeeping: Implement a scoreboard that tracks the Current Score and saves the Best Score (highest score achieved).
- Component Architecture: Properly plan and structure the application into reusable components.
